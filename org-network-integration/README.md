# 🔗 Risk-Based Network Integration Strategy for a Corporate Merger

📍 *Featured Project | Secure Network Design | Risk Management | HIPAA & SOX Compliance*

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world post-merger network integration between:

- **Company A**: A financial services firm bound by **SOX compliance**
- **Company B**: A healthcare software provider governed by **HIPAA**

The goal was to assess both companies' infrastructure and security postures, then design and implement a unified, secure, and compliant network under budget constraints. The solution leveraged modern cloud services (Azure), network segmentation, and identity access management to minimize risks and improve regulatory posture.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Conduct gap analysis of legacy infrastructure and vendor dependencies
- Identify critical security risks (outdated systems, weak passwords, no MFA)
- Design a **hybrid network architecture** using cloud-first principles
- Ensure compliance with **SOX** and **HIPAA**
- Establish a scalable foundation for future organizational growth

---

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- 🔐 Migrated to **Azure-based services**: Identity & Access, Security Center, Monitor, VPN, and Sentinel SIEM
- 🔄 Introduced **redundancy & segmentation** using VLANs and multi-site hardware upgrades
- 🔁 Implemented **MFA enforcement**, access role separation, and endpoint security upgrades
- 🔎 Addressed legacy vulnerabilities: FTP brute force, deprecated OS, weak credential policies

## 📋 Compliance Focus

| Framework | Applied Controls |
|-----------|------------------|
| **HIPAA / HITECH** | Secure ePHI transmission, MFA enforcement, data access control |
| **SOX** | Financial data protection via monitoring, access controls, audit readiness |
| **Risk-Based Strategy** | Addressed organizational risk appetite, emerging threats, and continuity |
