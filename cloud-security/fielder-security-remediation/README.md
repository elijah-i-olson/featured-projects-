# 🏥 Strategic Security Remediation: A NIST-Based Approach for Fielder Medical Center

📍 *Featured Project | GRC | Risk Management | Compliance | Healthcare Security*

---

## 📘 Overview

This project simulates a comprehensive security remediation initiative at **Fielder Medical Center (FMC)**, a federally funded healthcare provider. After an external assessment identified gaps in FMC's security framework, this project presents a full-scale remediation plan rooted in **NIST SP 800-53**, **FedRAMP**, and **PCI DSS** requirements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Address and remediate security control deficiencies
- Align organizational policies with **NIST AC-6**, **CA-5**, **RA-3**, and **RA-7**
- Improve **Risk Assessment**, **Risk Response**, and **Continuous Monitoring** practices
- Prepare for **PCI DSS compliance** to support POS system rollout
- Reduce risk exposure while protecting **PII** and **PHI**

---

## 🔍 Key Focus Areas

### ✅ Security Control Realignment
- Implemented **Least Privilege** (AC-6) and **Separation of Duties**
- Developed comprehensive **Plans of Action & Milestones** (CA-5)
- Launched **Continuous Monitoring Strategy** (CA-7)

### 📉 Risk Management
- Conducted risk assessments aligned with **RA-3**
- Built a scalable **Risk Response Plan** (RA-7) to address threats and findings
- Aligned with the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

### 🔐 PCI DSS Readiness
- Designed a payment system security strategy: VLAN segmentation, firewall review, AV deployment
- Proposed vendor analysis for **endpoint protection** (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)
